Combines several DNG files into one, as if they had been a single longer
exposure, or a single exposure at lower ISO (with -a). Only works with
uncompressed DNG files, only tested with those produced by the Pentax Q
with firmware 1.10.

Requires python 2.6 or 2.7.

Usage: stack.py [options] input1.dng input2.dng [input3.dng [...]] output.dng

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --average         Average sample values (instead of summing)
  -b BLACKLEVEL, --blacklevel=BLACKLEVEL
                        Override black level

All input files are combined into a single exposure output file. All
metadata, including the preview image and unparseable maker blocks, is
taken unmodified from the first input image, except exposure time which is
added from all and ISO which is averaged (and divided) as appropriate.
