Combines several DNG files into one, as if they had been a single longer
exposure. Only works with uncompressed DNG files, only tested with those
produced by the Pentax Q with firmware 1.10.

Requires python 2.6 or 2.7.

Usage: stack.py [-a] input1.dng input2.dng [input3.dng [...]] output.dng

Options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -a, --average  Average sample values (instead of summing)

All input files are combined into a single exposure output file. All
metadata, including the preview image and unparseable maker blocks, is
taken unmodified from the first input image, except exposure time which is
added from all.
